1. Write a function that takes two integers as arguments and returns their sum.

2. Write a function that takes a list of strings as an argument and returns a new list of strings that are all reversed.

3. Write a function that takes a list of strings as an argument and returns a new list with all the strings that have a length greater than 5.

4. Write a function that takes a string as an argument and returns two numbers, first for count of lower case symbols, second for count of the upper case symbols in the initial string.

5. Write a function that takes an ordered list of numbers without duplicates and returns a string with ranges for those numbers, check the example below:
get_ranges([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10])  ->  "0-4, 7-8, 10"
